@BeforeTest:
-----------
 --> BeforTest is for entire test suite, it executes only once for entire test suite and executes before all the @Test methods.
 --> if you declare BeforeTest in multiple classes then it follows the order defined in xml file, if ChatAdapter is the first class defined in test suite in xml 
 		then BeforeTest from ChatAdapter will execute first and then  BeforeTest from EmailAdapter will execute and so on
 		
@AfterTest:
----------
 --> AfterTest is for entire test suite, it executes only once for entire test suite and executes after all the @Test methods complete
 --> multiple AfterTest will work in same way as multiple BeforeTest
 
@BeforeMethod:
--------------
 --> BeforeMethod is particular to a class, it executes before each and every @Test methods inside that class

@BeforeMethod:
--------------
--> AfterMethod is particular to a class, it executes after each and every @Test methods inside that class
