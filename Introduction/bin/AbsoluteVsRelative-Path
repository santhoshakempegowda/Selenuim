The path with reference to root directory is called absolute. 
The path with reference to current directory is called relative.

absolute path (the one accessed directly using unique attribute) --> //*[@id='test1']
relative path is the one done using parent child relationship     --> //div[@class='RNNXgb']/div/div[2]/input 

absolute path is always better incase if tag changes tomorrow because of code refactoring then relative path will not work
