Implicit Wait :

--> will define a wait time globally.If there are 100 test cases then we can set an Implicit wait so that it will wait for some time between each step in entire test cases.
	Driver will wait for N number of seconds .i.e the time configured in Implicit wait
	Suppose if sepcify 5 sec , when clicked on search Driver will keep on listening to DOM to check whether result is available , 
	if result is available within 3 sec then it will come out of the wait instead of waiting for 5 Sec.
	If result is not available even after 5 sec then exception is thrown

Explicit Wait :

--> Will define a wait time specifically not globally. we can configure an explicit wait on specific web elements.

Thread.sleep() :
--> Java method will hold the driver till the time specified in sleep method , it will not listen to DOM.
